# Data-Analysis-on-Tamil-Nadu-Road-Accidents

The "Data Analysis on Tamil Nadu Road Accidents" is a project deals with analysis of data on Road Accidents encountered by Tamil Nadu ( one of the states of India ) in the year of 2020 and 2021. But the dataset is most recently created (created on February 15, 2023 with source form TN Police). The reason why i have chosen especial Tamil Nadu is that it is the state that has been accounted for the **Highest number of road accidents in India** that takes place on National high-ways and express-ways. This project is more like an **End-to-End Data Analytics project** which integrates a collection of **skills and tools** such as : 
    
*NumPy and Pandas* for Data Cleaning. It could have been better to perform Initial Data Cleaning / Data Pre-processing more faster if i used Spreadsheet. But the only reason why i used Python libraries for Data Cleaning / Data pre-processing is that i can clearly demonstrate each and every step of data cleaning using it. For an instance, how the data has been converted from it's original format into the correct format (if the original data is wrong).
    
*Geophy* for Feature Engineering (created a new field using information from already existing fields, which can have scopes of usage in future.)

*Matplotlib, Seaborn and Folium* for general Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and for some basic Data Visualizations within the Jupyter Notebook.
    
*Tableau* for Visualizations of Key Findings / Insights and for creating the final Dashboard.

As the conclusion, my project demonstrates the power of data cleaning, data transformation, feature engineering, exploratory analysis and data visualization to gather valuable data for further analysis. It provides users with a valuable Aesthetic Dashboard to view the Graphical Representation of Road Accidents in Tamil Nadu in the year 2020 & 2021.
